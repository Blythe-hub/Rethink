# Rethink
Enhancing student note taking


What it does
Our project uses flask to convert our Python scripts into action on a web app allowing users to convert speech to text, summarize it, translate it and combine these features to create a powerful tool to RETHINK our notes. Over on the left side you are able to see options ...

How we built it
We built this project with multiple libraries and created a front end website from scratch. We used python's speech recognition library to allow our users to use the user's microphones turn that into text, then use NTLK library to summarize that text and also have the ability to translate this text using Python's translate library after recognizing the speech to summarize.

What we learned
We learned how to integrate a translation library script with flask, being able to use NLTK Python library to summarize text, integrating this with Flask, creating a front end environment for the user to interact and getting a lot more comfortable with the abilities of Python.

What's next for Rethink
We hope to deploy this web application into the real world for students like us take notes for the critical years of high school and college effectively.
